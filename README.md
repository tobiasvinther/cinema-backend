This is a template for a backend to use for a fullstack exam project. The packages structure is set up with example 
classes inside. Change or switch out these classes when you begin coding.
Applications.properties has also been written, but you of course need to put in the values for the environment values.

CI/CD
Create an app-service on Azure to host the backend. Also create a virtual machine and use docker to install MySQL on 
this virtual machine.

Get github action from Azure and add it to the project.
